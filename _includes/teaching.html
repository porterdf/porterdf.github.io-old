                      <b>Secondary School Field Research Program (SSFRP)</b>
                      <br>
                      I teach the Data Analysis section for Lamont's SSFRP in the Fall semester. Students have spent months collecting data in the march.  It is my job to teach them how to place their group's newly collected data in context with those from other groups, as well as to look at changes from year-to-year. In this way, students take ownership of their data, understand how it is unique and may be valuable to scientists in the future, and learn the importance of thoughtful sampling techniques and data stewardship.

                      "The Lamont-Doherty Secondary School Field Research Program brings High School teachers and their students together with scientists from the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory to work on scientific research projects. The program was founded in 2005, and works with teachers and students from several New York City public high schools. The goal is to give teachers and students a hands-on understanding of the scientific process at the same time that they engage with the content of a particular area of Earth Science. Participating in field work and seeing their students work alongside professional scientists changes teachersâ€™ sense of what is possible for the students. For teachers and students alike, the Program validates science as a career choice and helps bridge students into science majors in college."
