- name: Community Partnerships in Kullorsuaq, Greenland
  description: There are dozens of resilient communities living and working around the coast of Greenland.  In July 2014, Margie Turrin and I went to Kullorsuaq, a small community of about 450 resident to build a partnership for the collection of unique oceanographic data in nearby coastal waters.  Alison Glacier, which empties into their local fjord, has retreated dramatically in the past decade.  Interestingly, neigboring glaciers have lost much less mass in the same period.  With the help of local fishermen and educators, we are working to understand how much a role warming ocean water had in the exceptional retreat of Alison.

- name: Airborne Gravity Measurements for Bathymetry
  description: "While we can measure topography under cold grounded ice with ground or airborne ice-penetrating radar, bathymetry under floating ice requires special techniques. By measuring changes in relative gravity and making some assumption of densities we can model bathymetry under ice shelf and sea ice covered regions of the world.  We do this from airborne platforms to increase the coverage area."
